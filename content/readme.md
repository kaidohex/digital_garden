## ⚡ Module Dashboards

Every module has its own **dashboard** with coordinates, deck logs, and atomic module links:

- **C.md – Jet Deck** 💻  
- **C++.md – Rocket Deck** 🚀  
- **Assembly.md – Assembly Dock** 🛠️  
- **Architecture.md – Architecture Wing** 🖥️  
- **Operating_Systems.md – Kernel Deck** ⚙️  
- **ML_AI.md – ML Lab** 🤖  
- **Physics.md – Physics Observation Deck** 🌌

## 💡 Usage

1. Open the vault in **Obsidian**.  
2. Navigate using the **graph view** or the main dashboard (`kepler_base.md`).  
3. Each module contains **atomic notes** (flashcards or short references) for efficient learning.  
4. Use the **aliases / emojis** to easily identify decks in graph view.

## 🔧 Notes

- `.obsidian` folder is partially synced; plugin configurations may need local setup.  
- New modules or future expansions can be added under the **Research Modules** or **Deactivated Wings** sections.  
- Commit messages follow the **Kepler Base orbital log style** for immersive version history.
